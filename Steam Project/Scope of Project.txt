Scope of Steam Video Game Data

First Data Set: Video gamess, Users ID, purchase or play, hours they played
Transform to group by user ID: Then look at game data

query table for first data set game id, game name, played or purchased, total hours

Second Data Set: For that video game look at genre, price, review of game, 

Third Data Set: Pc requirements to play game

I will be looking at three different data sets to analyze Steam Video games
This will incude information about what individual games are played, how often, price, requirements for computer
most purchases. 
The information I will be analyzing is still fluid but overall goal the includes the following:
Analyze most popular games
Determine what types of games are popular
Are those games free to play or purchase
Are those games that are free played more or purchased



After analyzine the data, these were the conclusions gained:

People prefer to spend more time playing free games; these free games usually have in-game purchases or downloadable content. The top two games that were popular/played on Steam were Dota2 and Team Fortress. These two games are multiplayer games suggesting that people like to play with friends rather than single player. The other piece of information we gained by analzying the data was that these games do not require expensive computers to play the game.
