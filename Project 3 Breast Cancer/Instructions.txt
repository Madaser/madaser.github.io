The untitled python files contains all of the code for the machine learning.
Matplotlib, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, decisiontree/random forest, KNN were the methods mostly used to complete this project
Additional libraries were needed at times for data analysis such as the confusion matrix

Project Goals:

Can we detect breast cancer using machine learning?
Can we do this with such success to minimize false positives and false negatives?
Can we analze what the machine thinks are the most important features that correlate to a tumor being malignant?
Which method of machine learning would be the most useful, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and PPV?
